# stream-utils

This utility is used to read an excel file.

The configuration of the path to the excel file can be found in src\main\java\utils\ui\UtilsUIServer.java.

Furthermore, it uses apache POI to read and print out the contents of the excel file at the moment.

To run, in excel-utils, run mvn clean install.

Then inside target, run "java -jar test.utils.uberjar...".

Note: next step is to rename the file and inculde some nice database configs. Maybe add some nice UI for later.
